Use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (a free editor for audio files) to cut the audio section that you want to remove and export it back to the same audio type.
Sometimes, Spotify doesn't provide the current track info in time resulting in these results. Also, you may have better results after [tweaking Spotify settings](#maximize-quality-spotify-settings).
