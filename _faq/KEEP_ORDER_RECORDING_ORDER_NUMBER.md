The recording order number option `017_Artist_-_Title.mp3` is useful if you want to burn songs to CDs and that your MP3 player, like those in cars, orders songs by filename. 
You will get a CD with songs ordered in the same order than the album or the one shown by Spotify. If it's a playlist, order it first on Spotify before recording it.
