Spotify looks for local music files before playing a track. If it finds one matching the metadata of the current song, it will play the local one instead. Cut track means that you started recording this track once and you ended the session too early. Just delete these incomplete tracks in your music directory to solve your issue. You can display local files in your Spotify Desktop app settings in the **Local File** section with the toggle *Show Local Files*.
