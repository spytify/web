By using the Spytify setting **Audio Device**, you can move Spytify to a different audio endpoint (install [virtual audio cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/) if you need another one) and use the Windows 10 setting to move Spotify to the same audio endpoint.

- Press Windows key and type **Sound mixer options**, you should land on the setting page titled *App volume and device preferences*.
- Make sure Spotify is playing and set the app to the desired endpoint using the **Output** select list.
- Restart Spotify. Spotify and Spytify should now be isolated from any undesired sound.

If you can't find the Windows 10 setting, try the section ***Windows 10 Settings ðŸ¡‚ System ðŸ¡‚ Sound***, scroll down to the ***Advanced sound options ðŸ¡‚ App volume and device preferences*** setting.
