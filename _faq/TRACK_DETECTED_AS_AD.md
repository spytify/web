Podcast, audio book and any other uncommon track type are detected as an ad. Also, Spotify doesn't return to Spytify the right info when you switch between radios, playlists and albums, resulting in a track detected as an ad. If this happens, replay the current song, if this happens too often, create a playlist of the songs you want to save and play it.
