Spytify is a Spotify recorder for Windows which records Spotify audio without recording or playing ads, ensuring no loss in sound quality. It automatically splits songs into separate tracks and records to MP3 with media metadata, meaning you can start easily enjoying your music offline.

## [How it works?](#how-it-works)
Spytify records what Spotify outputs, which is a longer process than downloading a Spotify playlist with a tool. 

However, Spytify ensures that all tracks will be the official released one, all sound volume normalized and with media tags and album cover. Playlist Downloaders get mostly all tracks from YouTube which means that they can't guarantee the choosen track will fit 100% the one in your playlist and they will all be the same quality.

Spytify records the same quality that Spotify outputs (Spotify Free 160kbps, Spotify Premium 320kbps), so the recorded copy will be indistinguishable from Spotifyâ€™s one.

### [Standard use](#standard-use)
A standard use is to start a recording session at night using your favorite playlist and let it work overnight, so you avoid waiting for it to end, because Spytify does not download but records. You will then get all your songs automatically split into separate tracks without ads.

## [Requirements](#requirements)
Spytify runs on Windows only.
- Microsoft Framework ([.NET 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48130) or higher).
- Spotify Desktop application.

A __free Spotify account__ will work, but Spotify restricts audio quality to 120 kbps. Having a Premium Spotify subscription will enable recording of up to 320 kbps audio.
